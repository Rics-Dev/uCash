GOOD TO KNOW:
You're building a mobile app. You're missing out on thousands of dollars if you're not doing this one thing. Onboarding is the most important part of building your app. If people don't know why they need it, then they're not going to buy it. And it shouldn't just be what your app does. It should be a story of how their life is going to improve after they use your app. The number one thing people hate is when you waste your time. So stop making it such a long process where it's just boring the entire way through. Make the process fun. People value their time, so stop wasting it. The most important thing that will make your app thousands of dollars is having a hard paywall. No more freemium. If you want to make money, you have to demand that they pay for your app.
