This screen answers the question: **"Where did it all go?"**

While the Activity screen handles the *What*, the Analytics screen handles the *Why*. To make this "Best in Class," it cannot just be a static report. It must be an **interactive tool for behavior change**.

Here is the detailed Top-to-Bottom UX for the **Analytics / Insights Screen**.

-----

### 1\. The Time Control Deck (Header)

*Top 15% of the screen. Fixed.*

Don't hide the date picker. The most common user frustration in analytics is "getting lost in time."

  * **The Period Selector:** A "Segmented Control" (pill shape) right at the top.
      * **[ Week ] [ Month ] [ Year ]**
  * **The Date Scroller:** Below the pills, a centered date with arrows.
      * `< October 2023 >`
      * **UX Magic:** Allow the user to **Swipe Left/Right** anywhere on the chart area to change months. This feels incredibly fluid.

### 2\. The Visual Core (The Interactive Donut)

*Top 35% of the screen.*

The standard Pie Chart is often bad UX because small slices are unclickable. We will use a **Donut Chart** with a "Focus Center."

  * **The Visual:** A thick ring chart.
      * Only show the top 5 categories as distinct colors.
      * Group everything else into a grey slice called "Others" (to reduce visual noise).
  * **The "Hole" (Center Info):**
      * Inside the donut, display the **Total Spent** for the selected period (e.g., "$2,450").
  * **The Interaction (The "Touch Ring"):**
      * When the user taps a colored slice (e.g., the Red "Dining" slice):
        1.  The slice expands slightly (pops out).
        2.  The text in the *center of the donut* changes from the Total to the **Category Total** (e.g., "Dining: $600").
        3.  The list below filters instantly to show only dining sub-categories.

### 3\. The Cash Flow Bar (Income vs. Expense)

*Middle 10% of the screen.*

Before diving into spending, show the net result.

  * **Visual:** A single horizontal bar, split in two.
      * Left side (Green): Income.
      * Right side (Grey/Black): Expenses.
  * **Text:**
      * "Saved 20% of income" (If Green \> Grey).
      * "Overspent by $200" (If Grey \> Green).

-----

### 4\. The "Hit List" (Category Ranking)

*Bottom 40% of the screen. Scrollable.*

This is where the user identifies bad habits.

  * **Sorting:** Always sort Largest Spend $\to$ Smallest Spend.
  * **The Row Design:**
      * **Left:** Category Icon in a colored circle (matches the donut slice color).
      * **Middle:** Category Name (e.g., **Groceries**) + % of Total (e.g., "15%").
      * **Right:** The Amount (e.g., **$450.00**).
      * **Visual Bar:** Behind the text, a subtle grey progress bar showing the volume relative to the biggest category.

-----

### 5\. The "Trend" Overlay (The Pro Feature)

*Contextual UX.*

What if I want to know if my grocery spending is *normal*?

  * **The Feature:** When the user taps a category in the list (e.g., Groceries), don't just open the transactions. **Expand the row** (accordion style) or open a Bottom Sheet.
  * **The Insight:** Show a mini bar chart comparing *This Month* vs. *Average Month*.
      * *Text:* "You spent $50 **more** on Groceries than usual."

### 6\. The Logic & Data Structure

To make this screen instant (no loading spinners when tapping slices), the app should calculate totals *locally*.

### Summary of the Flow

1.  **Select Date:** User swipes to "November."
2.  **Scan:** User sees the big Donut. "Wow, the red slice is huge."
3.  **Interact:** User taps the Red slice. Center text says "$600 - Dining."
4.  **Drill Down:** User scrolls down to the list, taps "Dining."
5.  **Insight:** App says "This is $100 higher than your average."
6.  **Action:** User taps "See Transactions" to jump to the **Activity Screen** (pre-filtered for Dining).
