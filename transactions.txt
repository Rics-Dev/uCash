This screen is the "Ledger." It is the workhorse of the application.

While the Dashboard is for glancing, the Activity screen is for management. The "Best in the World" UX here solves one specific problem: Cognitive Load. A raw list of 1,000 transactions is overwhelming. We must turn it into a scannable, searchable, and interactive feed.

Here is the detailed UX breakdown for the Activity / Transactions Screen.

1. The Header (Search & Filter Stack)
Top 15% of the screen. Sticky.

You need a powerful "Command Bar" here.

Row 1: The Smart Search

Component: Full-width Search Bar with a "Microphone" icon (voice search) and "Scan" icon (OCR for receipts).

UX: When the user types "Star," it should instantly auto-suggest "Starbucks," "Star Market," etc.

Placeholder: "Search merchant, amount, or note..."

Row 2: The "Chipped" Filters (Horizontal Scroll)

Instead of a complex filter menu, use "Filter Chips" that users can toggle instantly.

[Chip 1: This Month v] (Date Picker)

[Chip 2: All Accounts v] (Select specific card)

[Chip 3: Categories v]

[Chip 4: Income/Expense]

2. The Feed (The List Structure)
The Core Content. Infinite Scroll.

Do not display a flat list. You must Group by Date.

A. The Date Headers (Sticky)
As you scroll down, the date (e.g., "Today" or "November 24") should stick to the top of the screen until the next date pushes it away.

Left: Date ("Fri, Nov 24")

Right: Daily Total ("-$45.20"). This is a subtle but powerful insight—how much did I spend that specific day?

B. The Transaction Row (The Component)
This row needs 5 distinct pieces of information, balanced perfectly.

1. The Visual Anchor (Left):

Best Case: The Merchant Logo (e.g., the Uber "U"). This allows the brain to process the list 10x faster than reading text.

Fallback: A colored circle with a Category Icon (e.g., a Fork for food).

2. The Primary Text (Top Middle):

Merchant Name: Bold, Dark Text. (e.g., Uber Eats).

3. The Context (Bottom Middle):

Category • Account: Small, Grey Text.

Example: "Dining • Chase Sapphire"

4. The Amount (Top Right):

Negative: Standard Black (or dark grey). Don't use Red for everything—it causes "alert fatigue." Only use Red for Unusual spending.

Positive: Green + Bold.

5. The Status Indicator (Bottom Right):

If the transaction is Pending, show a small clock icon or make the text opacity 50%.

If it is Recurring, show a small "loop" icon.

3. Gestures & Interactions (The Power Features)
Mobile UX relies on "hidden" gestures to keep the interface clean.

Swipe Right (Positive Action):

Background: Blue.

Icon: "Edit" or "Duplicate."

Use Case: You bought coffee for a friend and want to split the cost, or you need to add a note.

Swipe Left (Negative Action):

Background: Red.

Icon: "Delete" or "Hide."

Use Case: Removing a manual entry error.

Long Press (Bulk Mode):

Hold down on one transaction -> The UI shifts. Checkboxes appear next to every row.

Bottom Bar Appears: "Change Category," "Delete," "Exclude from Budget."

Why: Great for fixing 10 uncategorized transactions at once.

4. The "Detail" View (Drill-Down)
When a user taps a specific row (e.g., "Target - $124.00"), don't just show a popup. Slide in a full detail screen.

Top: Huge Map showing exactly where the transaction happened (Google Maps integration).

Middle: Break down the details (Date, Time, Category).

Notes Field: "Birthday gift for Mom."

Attachment: "Add Receipt Photo" button.

History: "You have spent $1,200 at Target this year" (Contextual Insight).

5. Developer Logic (States to Handle)
To make this bulletproof, you must code for these edge cases:

Skeleton State: While loading, show grey bars pulsing.

Empty State: If a filter returns no results (e.g., "Income" on a day you didn't work), show a fun illustration. Text: "No income found. A quiet day!"

The "Pending" State: Pending transactions usually don't have a final category yet. Visually distinguish them so the user knows they might change.
